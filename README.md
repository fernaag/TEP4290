## Learning goals

The students acquire the concepts and skills necessary to develop dynamic MFA models (focus on stock dynamics) with applications for vehicles and buildings using Python. In particular, the students will learn (i) to select appropriate modeling approaches given the questions to be answered (e.g., time-cohort, type-cohort, and time type matrices, or approaches for modeling renovation) (ii), to conduct a literature survey to frame policy relevant questions for the scenario development and the model calibration, (iii) to apply different approaches for parameter estimation with limited data, (iv) to develop different types of policy-relevant scenarios (e.g., open-end, target), (v) to interpret the results in a policy and in a methodological context, (vi) to present and defend the results in short presentations (using rationales based on systems thinking), and (vii) to write a short scientific report.

## Background

Sustainable development involves a transformation of the current socio-metabolic systems towards future ones that account for societies’ increasing dependence on the Earth as a source of raw materials and energy and as a sink for emissions. Such transformations usually require a change of built environment stocks, which in turn creates demand for new (e.g., alternative) resources, obsolete products for potential recovery as secondary resources, and changes in energy use and emissions along the entire supply chain. Policy intervention options for sustainable development therefore need to be assessed from a systems perspective that includes built environment stocks.

## Motivation

The students will learn to describe the transformation of built environment stocks in physical terms. Concepts of stock dynamics are employed using the examples of vehicles and buildings. The focus of both examples lies in direct energy use of the stocks (material consequences were discussed in the MFA course). In both exercises, the students will inform themselves about the policy context, and learn how to develop appropriate models (including programming in Python), how to deal with limited data availability, to develop policy relevant scenarios, and to interpret the findings from a policy and methodological context.

## Course structure

The course is based on a combination of lectures, seminars, warm-ups, and a larger exercise. Under supervision of the teachers, the students develop their own Python model, which is first used in a simple exercise of the vehicle stock in China, and subsequently extended for the building stock in selected countries. 

The students conduct the warm-ups individually, while the exercise is conducted in groups consisting of 2-3 students. 

## Warm-ups

The warm-ups are short tasks that introduce the students to the basic concepts of Python programming and implement these concepts for a simple model on the energy use of the vehicle fleet. This model serves as a basis for the exercise on the modelling of the carbon emission of the building stock.

## Exercise

Exercise one is conducted using case studies of the national dwelling stock in different countries. All of the country case studies have participated in the EU-projects TABULA – Typology Approach for Building Stock Energy Assessment and EPISCOPE – Energy Performance Indicator Tracking Schemes for the Continuous Optimization of Refurbishment Processes in European Housing Stocks (www.episcope.eu). In this project, the partners developed national building typologies representing the residential building stock of their countries. The typologies consist of the following elements:
•	a classification concept for existing residential buildings according to age, size and further parameters,
•	a set of example buildings which represent specific building types of the national stocks,
•	typical energy consumption values for the example buildings, 
•	showcase calculations of the possible energy savings,
•	statistical data for buildings and supply systems.
Some of the countries have also carried out an energy balance for the total dwelling stock in the country, and these countries are studied in the case study. Since all of the partners used the same methodology for assessing their national dwelling stock, we expect that all of the case studies have similar types of data available (although there might be large differences in detailed data availability). The TABULA project aimed solely at assessing the current status of the building stock, without inclusion of stock dynamics or future scenarios. The purpose of this exercise is to use the data from TABULA combined with additional data from national statistics or other sources, additional information from the national contact persons as well as qualified assumptions and develop a dynamic MFA for scenario development and assessment of policy intervention options related to direct energy use.

In seminar 1, we discuss the key literature on assigned country case studies (some background papers and reports are given on its learning, but the students can include other important literature they find by themselves). The students present the current status of the dwelling stock and its energy use and emissions, the methods they have used (model, parameter estimation), the first results and their interpretation, and a workplan of how they intend to develop the further work. Each group has 10-12 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for discussion.

Seminar 2 is the final presentation of the work (exercise 2). This includes an introduction (problems, goals, questions), a methodology part (model, data, assumptions), results, and interpretation in a policy and methodology context.  Each group has 15 minutes for presentation and 5 minutes for discussion.

In addition to the seminar presentations, the students write a report on their topics assigned. The report includes an introduction (incl. literature survey), a methodology section, a results section, a discussion section, a references section, and an appendix with the documentation of the model and data used. The total report should be in the range of 15-30 pages (content is more important than length!).
