Assign the input data to the instance of the object.\n     |  \n     |  check_stock_balance(self)\n     |      Check wether inflow, outflow, and stock are balanced. If possible, the method returns the vector 'Balance', where Balance = inflow - outflow - stock_change\n     |  \n     |  compute_evolution_initialstock(self, InitialStock, SwitchTime)\n     |      Assume InitialStock is a vector that contains the age structure of the stock at time t0, \n     |      and it covers as many historic cohorts as there are elements in it.\n     |      This method then computes the future stock and outflow from the year SwitchTime onwards.\n     |      Only future years, i.e., years after SwitchTime, are computed.\n     |      NOTE: This method ignores and deletes previously calculated s_c and o_c.\n     |      The InitialStock is a vector of the age-cohort composition of the stock at SwitchTime, with length SwitchTime\n     |  \n     |  compute_i_c_from_s_c(self, InitialStock)\n     |      Given a stock at t0 broken down by different cohorts tx ... t0, an \"initial stock\". \n     |      This method calculates the original inflow that generated this stock.\n     |      Example:\n     |  \n     |  compute_i_from_s(self, InitialStock)\n     |      Given a stock at t0 broken down by different cohorts tx ... t0, an \"initial stock\". \n     |      This method calculates the original inflow that generated this stock.\n     |      Example:\n     |  \n     |  compute_o_c_from_s_c(self)\n     |      Compute outflow by cohort from stock by cohort.\n     |  \n     |  compute_o_c_from_s_c_with_i_c(self)\n     |      Compute outflow by cohort from stock by cohort.\n     |  \n     |  compute_outflow_mb(self)\n     |      Compute outflow from process via mass balance. \n     |      Needed in cases where lifetime is zero.\n     |  \n     |  compute_outflow_pdf(self)\n     |      Lifetime model. The method compute outflow_pdf returns an array year-by-cohort of the probability of a item added to stock in year m (aka cohort m) leaves in in year n. This value equals pdf(n,m).\n     |      This is the only method for the inflow-driven model where the lifetime distribution directly enters the computation. All other stock variables are determined by mass balance.\n     |      The shape of the output pdf array is NoofYears * NoofYears, but the meaning is years by age-cohorts.\n     |      The method does nothing if the pdf alreay exists.\n     |  \n     |  compute_outflow_total(self)\n     |      Determine total outflow as row sum of cohort-specific outflow.\n     |  \n     |  compute_s_c_from_i_c(self)\n     |      With given inflow and lifetime distribution, the method builds the stock by cohort. It also allows for older cohorts to be considered in the model.\n     |  \n     |  compute_s_c_inflow_driven(self)\n     |      With given inflow and lifetime distribution, the method builds the stock by cohort.\n     |  \n     |  compute_sf(self)\n     |      Survival table self.sf(m,n) denotes the share of an inflow in year n (age-cohort) still present at the end of year m (after m-n years).\n     |      The computation is self.sf(m,n) = ProbDist.sf(m-n), where ProbDist is the appropriate scipy function for the lifetime model chosen.\n     |      For lifetimes 0 the sf is also 0, meaning that the age-cohort leaves during the same year of the inflow.\n     |      The method compute outflow_sf returns an array year-by-cohort of the surviving fraction of a flow added to stock in year m (aka cohort m) in in year n. This value equals sf(n,m).\n     |      This is the only method for the inflow-driven model where the lifetime distribution directly enters the computation. All other stock variables are determined by mass balance.\n     |      The shape of the output sf array is NoofYears * NoofYears, and the meaning is years by age-cohorts.\n     |      The method does nothing if the sf alreay exists. For example, sf could be assigned to the dynamic stock model from an exogenous computation to save time.\n     |  \n     |  compute_stock_change(self)\n     |      Determine stock change from time series for stock.
